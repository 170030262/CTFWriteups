**We were provided with 7 images which included 6 jpg and 1 png format**. You can find them [HERE](https://github.com/FrigidSec/CTFWriteups/tree/master/ASCWG/fingerprint/_docs/chal_images)

There wasnâ€™t any clue in the images, so lets dig into actual forensics part.

First of all, we checked all the jpg images with *steghide* and the png image with *zteg* to check whether something is embedded in the images or not. 
All the images contained some embedded things in it, which required a passphrase to discover.. :(


Then just manually checked all the images with *strings* utility, hoping to get something interesting out of the images. 
> YEP! we got an B64 encoded string out of the image named 3.jpg.
	
The padding at the end of the string pointed to direction of base64 encoding.

The base64 decoding of the string, gave a hex encoded output, then decoded that hex to get a set of gibbris hraw output which had RAR header signature in it, so rar file it was, so we saved it as rar file.

The rar file we saved was password protected!! There was no clue for the password in any of the metadata or strings in any of the images..

So **extracted the password protected rar hash using rar2john**, then fired up *JTR to crack* the password hash using the *rockyou.txt* wordlist and boom the password was cracked: **komputer** and we got the flag!
