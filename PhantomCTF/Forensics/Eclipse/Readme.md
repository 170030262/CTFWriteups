# Eclipse

Sorry I don't have the challenge file..

It will not matter that much, as I will guide you thoroughly!

We were given a file named Eclipse.txt . When I tried to open the file it popped up error: **There was a problem opening the file** 

So I checked the file format using the **file** command it said that it is a **jpeg** file. OK then! changed the extension to **Eclipse.jpeg** and the file could be opened now. It had some binary numbers displayed along with an Eclipse. So next step was to convert that binary to ASCII, it gave the flag. 
Easy one..
