# Jiffy

**Description: Someone told me you can fix broken things in a Jiffy**

Sorry I don't have the challenge file..
It will not matter that much, as I will guide you thoroughly!

The challenge description gave the clue that we would have deal with something like fixing **file headers**

We were given a file named **Jiffy.gif** . When I tried to open the file it popped up a error similar to **not a gif file** .

So fixed the headers and converted that gif to a static png images using a online tool and we were good to go with the **FLAG**
