# Welcome-note
The file for this challenge u can find it [here](https://github.com/FrigidSec/CTFWriteups/new/master/PhantomCTF/Crypto)

We were given an image , the image looked weird!! It looked liked some kind of ancient language..
We tried to guess the language using **Google Lens** but it miserably failed!! It was also confused as we were...
 
So again **ctf-katana Framework** to the rescue, it stated that it is **Sheikah language**.You can decode it [here]([https://www.dcode.fr/sheikah-language](https://www.dcode.fr/sheikah-language)
So the flag is:

**pCTF{CYBSEC_W31C0ME5_YOU_T0_TH3_PH4N7OM_C7F_3.O}**
